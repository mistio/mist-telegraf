# Telegraf Configuration
#
# Telegraf is entirely plugin driven. All metrics are gathered from the
# declared inputs, and sent to the declared outputs.
#
# Plugins must be declared in here to be active. To deactivate a plugin,
# comment out the name and any variables.
#
# Use 'telegraf -config telegraf.conf -test' to see what metrics a config
# file would generate.
#
# Environment variables can be used anywhere in this config file, simply
# prepend them with $. For strings the variable must be within quotes as
# "$STR_VAR", for numbers and booleans it should be plain: $INT_VAR, $BOOL_VAR.
